								<p>A Lead DevOps Software Developer is a pivotal role in modern software development, responsible for bridging the gap between development and operations teams. They lead and coordinate the implementation of DevOps practices, focusing on collaboration, automation, and streamlining the software development life cycle to ensure efficient and reliable delivery of software systems. A Lead DevOps Software Developer possesses a diverse skill set, combining software development expertise with operational knowledge. They utilize various tools and technologies to support continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure management. Proficiency in Python, Jenkins, Git, Bitbucket, Groovy, and Subversion are highly valued skills for a Lead DevOps Software Developer, empowering them to automate tasks, manage version control, and optimize the deployment and maintenance of software applications.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Python: Python is a popular programming language used by Lead DevOps Software Developers for scripting, automation, and infrastructure management. They leverage Python's extensive library ecosystem and simplicity of syntax to create automation scripts, build robust tooling, and interact with various system components.</li>
									<li>Jenkins: Jenkins is an essential open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Lead DevOps Software Developers proficient in Jenkins configure, customize, and orchestrate automated build, test, and deployment processes, enabling teams to deliver software changes rapidly and reliably.</li>
									<li>Git: Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently on a codebase. Proficient Lead DevOps Software Developers manage source code repositories, create branches, merge changes, and handle version control using Git, ensuring efficient collaboration and tracking of code changes.</li>
									<li>Bitbucket: Bitbucket is a web-based version control platform supporting Git repositories, code reviews, issue tracking, and continuous integration. Lead DevOps Software Developers proficient in Bitbucket effectively manage repositories, collaborate with teams, and seamlessly integrate code changes with CI/CD pipelines.</li>
									<li>Groovy: Groovy, a dynamic scripting language running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), is used by Lead DevOps Software Developers to automate tasks, create custom plugins, and extend the functionality of tools like Jenkins. They leverage Groovy's concise syntax and powerful capabilities to enhance automation and efficiency.</li>
									<li>Subversion: Subversion (SVN) is a centralized version control system used by Lead DevOps Software Developers to manage source code, track revisions, and facilitate collaboration in SVN-based environments.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>By possessing expertise in Python, Jenkins, Git, Bitbucket, Groovy, and Subversion, a Lead DevOps Software Developer effectively implements automation, streamlines processes, enhances collaboration, and ensures the efficient delivery of software systems throughout the development life cycle</p>

								<h3 class="major">Password Checker</h3>
								<p>A Python script that utilizes the Pwned Passwords API to check the exposure status of passwords supplied as arguments. It generates SHA-1 hashes of the passwords and sends the first five characters to the API, which responds with matching password hashes. By comparing the remaining characters, the script determines if the password has been compromised or not. If a match is found, it notifies the user about the number of occurrences, indicating the password has been exposed. Conversely, if no match is found, the script informs the user that their password was not found in any known data breaches, ensuring it hasn't been exposed. The script emphasizes the importance of using unique and strong passwords for enhanced security, while following best practices for secure handling of sensitive user data.</p>
